To Do Next
==============

1. convert scaffolding-pluralsight 
    * to webdriverio tests, so that I can test webdriverio on the fly
    * to repl, so that I can test promise on the fly


What this project is about
=============================

This is the place holder for all the settings, workflow, concepts to get started in working in ES6/Node.js/React/WebStorm.


Basic Stack
-------------

* Documentation: Cloud9/Github (thembbang)
* Asset management: Cloud9/Github
* Issue Management: Visual studio online 
* IDE: Webstorm/IntelliJ 
    * live-templates 
        * [create a gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist), turn into live template
        * Promise Templates (p.t, p.tc, p.c, p.n)
        * ES6 Class/Module Templates (6.c, 6.sc)
    * Save/Load Settings for WebStorm
    * setting up/loading/unloading should be done on the fly for the followings 
        * code completion settings
        * live template settings
        * file/code template settings
        

Web Stack
-------------

### Phase1

* Webpack, Webpack-dev-server, Babel-ES6
    * scaffolding/pluralsight-redix-start is really good, so, analyze, understand, then, lets yeo'rize. 
* React, Serve React
* Cucumber, Webdriverio, 

### Phase2

* Yeoman - so, things get repeated
* 

Workflow
-----------

* cloud9/github-thembbang workflow
    * should access private npm safely
    * should access private stash safely

* bulk-ops
    * bulk-git
    * bulk-npm
    * stash-api

* sandbox repl
    * test if fn returns promise or not
        ```
        var tp = function(callback) {
            return callback.then; // ??? is this valid?
        }
        ```

* NStudio workflow
    * workflow to automate test
    * workflow to develop a new component




Concept/Routine/Flow
